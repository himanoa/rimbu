I learned a lot from this effort about immutable data structures and\ncreating strict but useful types. However, after some time, I realized that Scala, while having a great compiler, was holding me back in writing the code I wanted\nto write. Also, it seemed the community was getting split (due to a complete rewrite of Scala), and its popularity seemed to go down. In the meantime, Scala does have\na new Vector implementation with the ",(0,a.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"insert")," and ",(0,a.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"remove")," methods.
